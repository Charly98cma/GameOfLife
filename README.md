# Conway's Game of Life
## Rules

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead
   cells stay dead.

### Additional rules

- Births and deaths occur simultaneously (on the same tick)
- Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one.
